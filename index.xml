      <description>BlurLock App This little application will hide valuable content on your screen from unwanted observers.
Here is how you can use it:
Select applications with Private or valuable information that you do not want to show accidentally during Zoom presentations or in person when you work with other apps on your screen. Press the “Blur Lock Apps” button to overlay a non-transparent window on top of those Application Windows. BlurLock will prevent anyone from peeking into your private information which you can unwantedly share.</description>
